Then I thought I would add triangles in the larger ones, then they turned into pyramids. I just kept adding detail until I reached something that looks like a geometric design almost alike something that would be on a rug. I like the way the pyramids look, just floating as if in space. I think the parts i dislike the most are the gray lines in the yellow circles which I think should have been smaller and not gone the whole way into the circle. I also would fix the green square I botched in the top.",

I did not trace the photo, I just had it up on my phone and glanced over at it while I sketched. Because I wasn't tracing, I didn't follow the perspective quite perfectly, but I think it still looks okay. The best part (in my opinion) is there treeline on the right, I think the stylized look is nice. The buddy board does look a little soulless without the hooks, I might go back on my own time and add them, as well as some other details.",

After that I went in-between all the well-defined trees and places rough tree-like shapes and forms, as well as shading behind the trees to give the illusion of a forest. Next I put the mountain in the background, with a snowcap, and added some atmospheric shading to sell the look. Then I added the sky using a few bands of color, blurred that layer to make a simple stepped but not harsh gradient, and added texture to it using a light brush. Finally I added a layer of clouds around the snowcap using a large brush. Overall I think it worked out. The bright sky compliments the dark reflection pretty well, and the mix of analogous colors in both the dark and the light side turned out good in my (definitely not at all biased) opinion.

                            writeup: "Once again I used Krita to do this project. I wanted to create something square-like, so I found this image which was my inspiration. I started by using the 2-point-assistant built into Krita to create a guide. Then, since I couldn't paint the guide onto the grid directly, I took a screenshot of it and then opened that screenshot in Krita to work further. Then I began adding the colors in, and added a rectangle over the center to cover the rough area in the center which would definitely prove to be very difficult to color otherwise (despite definitely looking cool if I did) and it also let me fit another color in. I had to change the color, and had to adjust the paint bucket tool to re-color properly without leaving a messy edge. From there I filled in each part of the pattern with parts of the color scheme. Once I was done, I made the canvas bigger, revealing an extra part of the rectangle in the center, so I cropped the image down again to remove it, then repeated the resize. When I started to repeat the tiles to make the pattern, I realized I had made a mistake and did not mirror the colors diagonally properly, so some colors weren't matched up, so I once again shrunk the canvas back down and mirrored it diagonally. Finally I was able to resize the canvas one last time, duplicate the pattern a few times, line them up into a grid, then merge them together, and repeat (twice). \n" +
                                "I think the pattern is okay, I like the cube effect that I got from the perspective guide, and I also like the lattice pattern it forms. My biggest issues are that for one it is a bit boring, I mean patterns are typically boring, but the strict color palette sort of kills the fun, as well as there are a few seems which are painfully obvious if you look close, I didn't notice them until I was done, but they are unfortunately hard to fix, since it is an issue with the edge of the tile itself, not just the alignment.",

I realized it started looking sort of mechanical, so I just went with it. Once I finished drawing the lines, I started coloring using dulled, mechanical-themed colors. This includes a circuit board green, and a copper-orange. I used a light and de-saturated blue on a circle with a grid in an attempt to symbolize a silicon wafer. I used light gray to convey metallic and sharp 'teeth'. Once I had finished the colored parts, I went back over the important lines with a dark black to emphasize them.",

The leftmost square was supposed to symbolize a pond, with complimentary colors (blue/yellow, green/purple). The middle square has a mask (It's a bit obscure, but I made it because I recently saw a play), it's supposed to be mysterious so I went with some darker colors and a analogous color scheme. Finally the rightmost square is half-clam-half-crocodile, and the color scheme is more skeuomorphic than anything, to make the forms more understandable. I think the thing this week taught me the most that I need some better paper that won't hate being dampened and curl up.",

I first did the objects, and their shadows and highlights, then I filled in the table and background. Then I let it dry and continued with the color layer. I used the technique mixing the complimentary color into the main color to get a darker color, and mixing white to get a lighter color and I also mixed yellow into the green for the highlights. Unfortunately the yellow I had left was pretty dry, so it didn't really mix in well on the cube.",

                            writeup: "I based this artwork off of an artwork that I have no idea who to attribute it to. Originally I thought it was a Henri Matisse work, but after taking a longer look at it while I used it as a reference, it didn't really look like an original Matisse and more like a rendition of one, which is the assumption I operated on. However after I finished creating my own rendition, I wanted to do a little more research, and couldn't turn up anything official attributing this to Henri Matisse, or any of the hundreds of other renditions I see in the search results. I also found a simpler version even more commonly attributed to Matisse that also just didn't seem officially backed up anywhere. It is similar to one of his goldfish paintings which is more official, but there is nothing I can find tying this to anyone. Perhaps it was created as an homage to Matisse. Either way, I could not find a really proper source unfortunately.\n" +

                                "First I started by tracing the major lines. Then I filled each section using a rough approximate color that represented the entire area decently well, as a base to add shading to. Finally, I shaded each section referencing the original (to a degree, the colors are a bit different). I think it's okay, although honestly I think there could be even more variation, also the view out of the window is quite dissimilar to the 'original', I wasn't quite sure what I was supposed to see to be honest. That said, I think I still got the fauvist colors right. Fauvists used strong and bright colors, that weren't naturalistic (they didn't use the same colors to represent something as you would find in nature), and instead they represented emotions. These colors can evoke more directly, emotions and ideas, rather than simply depicting a scene.\n",

Lessons of that day, don't cut it so close, and don't rush! (And save the correct document beforehand). Overall the piece is very basic, and the Battle Monument is in an entirely incorrect spot due to being frozen in a place that was supposed to be temporary!

This time, I still did not have much time (I had had a long day) however I made sure not to rush like I was last time and I used that version as a reference while making my next version. I added more *Green* (as in the Green Mountain State) shades and some trees to the piece as well as refining all the other parts of it. I made it more symmetrical as I originally intended with the first version, and made the Bennington Battle Monument look much more true-to-life (while still being simple to fit with the general aesthetic). If I had more time a few things I would do is add some smooth outlines to everything, I think it would really complete the infographic poster style I was going for, and could allow for some more details as well. The simplicity is partially by design, however I think they do look a bit too simple, perhaps I could have varied them with a 2-layer variant, and a variant made of circles?",
