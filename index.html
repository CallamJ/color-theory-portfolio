Then I thought I would add triangles in the larger ones, then they turned into pyramids. I just kept adding detail until I reached something that looks like a geometric design almost alike something that would be on a rug. I like the way the pyramids look, just floating as if in space. I think the parts i dislike the most are the gray lines in the yellow circles which I think should have been smaller and not gone the whole way into the circle. I also would fix the green square I botched in the top.",

I did not trace the photo, I just had it up on my phone and glanced over at it while I sketched. Because I wasn't tracing, I didn't follow the perspective quite perfectly, but I think it still looks okay. The best part (in my opinion) is there treeline on the right, I think the stylized look is nice. The buddy board does look a little soulless without the hooks, I might go back on my own time and add them, as well as some other details.",

In general, there are two parts of the portrait. There is me on the inside in green, holding myself in.

After that I went in-between all the well-defined trees and places rough tree-like shapes and forms, as well as shading behind the trees to give the illusion of a forest. Next I put the mountain in the background, with a snowcap, and added some atmospheric shading to sell the look. Then I added the sky using a few bands of color, blurred that layer to make a simple stepped but not harsh gradient, and added texture to it using a light brush. Finally I added a layer of clouds around the snowcap using a large brush. Overall I think it worked out. The bright sky compliments the dark reflection pretty well, and the mix of analogous colors in both the dark and the light side turned out good in my (definitely not at all biased) opinion.
